# airflow_dags
Collection of DAGs to run via Airflow (currently for the Copernicus project)

## Status
This repo is very much WIP and organization of code within may change any time.
E.g. subdirectories or function-libraries may be added. Also, more components
(unittests, documentation, ...) as well as DAGs need to be added.

## Some relevant documentation
